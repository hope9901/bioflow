# Changelog

> This file tracks **software releases**.
> For the monthly tool-registry update log see
> [`update/REGISTRY_CHANGELOG.md`](update/REGISTRY_CHANGELOG.md).

bioflow follows **Semantic Versioning** starting at 0.2.0.  Minor
releases (0.X.0) may add features and tools; patch releases (0.X.Y)
ship bug fixes only.  Breaking changes to the documented public API
(`bioflow.stage / pipeline / set_workspace / set_backend`, the
`bioflow` CLI surface, and tool YAML schema) wait for a major bump.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — 11 more commonly-used tools across categories
Digest-pinned, citations verified (9 via MEDLINE PMID; seqtk/sourmash are
DOI-only), and behaviour-checked with `verify_bump`:
- **variant_calling**: Ensembl VEP 116 (annotation), DeepVariant 1.10 (DL
  calling), Delly 2.3 (structural variants), VCFtools 0.1.17 (VCF utilities).
- **rnaseq_align**: HTSeq 2.1.2 (read counting).
- **qc**: seqtk r93 (sequence toolkit).
- **comparative_genomics**: FastTree 2.2, MUSCLE 5.3, trimAl 1.5.1
  (phylogenetics / MSA / alignment trimming).
- **struct_annot**: tRNAscan-SE 2.0.12 (tRNA detection).
- **metagenomics**: sourmash 4.9.4 (MinHash sketching / taxonomy).
VEP's cache is registered as a versioned reference DB, so it participates in
the `bioflow db` version-gated management + DB-version citations.

### Added — gene functional-annotation DBs with version-gated updates + DB-version citations
- New `func_annot` tools, digest-pinned, spanning kingdoms:
  **KofamScan** (KEGG KO), **DRAM** (bacteria/archaea/MAG metabolic annotation),
  **funannotate** (fungal annotation), **PfamScan** (Pfam domains, cross-kingdom,
  reuses the Pfam DB), and **GECCO** (ML biosynthetic-gene-cluster detection).
- **Run-time DB hook**: the stage runner now calls `ensure_dbs_for_image` just
  before an annotation container runs — checking each DB's version and
  auto-updating only the stale ones.  Opt-in via `$BIOFLOW_REFS` (the refs
  root); a no-op otherwise, and best-effort (a DB error never breaks the run),
  so ordinary/offline runs are unaffected.
- The functional-annotation databases (eggNOG, Pfam, dbCAN, antiSMASH, GTDB-Tk,
  KOfam) now carry a **version** and are managed lazily instead of re-downloaded
  on every run:
  - `bioflow db provision <db>` prints (or `--run` executes) the downloader that
    builds the DB **inside the consuming tool's own container**, so the DB build
    matches the pinned tool.  It does not download by default — the multi-GB fetch
    is an explicit opt-in.
  - `bioflow db status [--check-latest]` shows installed-vs-catalog-vs-upstream
    versions and an *update-available* flag.  A tiny version marker
    (`.bioflow_db_version`) records what's on disk.
  - `bioflow db update <db>` is **version-gated**: it re-downloads only when
    upstream is newer than the marker (a no-op otherwise), so it is safe on a
    schedule.  At run time `bioflow db ensure <tool>` / `db.ensure_db_current`
    checks each DB's version first and, **by default, auto-updates only the
    stale ones** before the tool runs (an up-to-date DB is a no-op — the cheap
    version check runs every time, the multi-GB download does not).  Pass
    `--no-update` / `auto_update=False` to only *flag* a newer DB instead.
  - `latest_db_version()` probes a small index/relnotes URL (never the payload)
    to learn the newest version; offline it stays silent (treated as "no update").
- **`bioflow cite` now includes the database version** next to the tool version,
  e.g. `eggNOG-mapper v2.1.15 (databases: eggNOG v5.0.2)` / `KofamScan v1.3.0
  (databases: KOfam v2024-01-01)` — so a methods section can cite both, which
  move on independent release cadences.

### Added — I/O contract drift guard across version bumps
- Every tool declares the data formats it consumes/produces (`input_types` /
  `output_types`).  A version bump that also changes those formats can break a
  downstream recipe stage, so `registry/io_contracts.json` now snapshots every
  tool's `(version, inputs, outputs)` and a new blocking CI job (`io-contracts`)
  fails until the snapshot is regenerated — the same freshness contract as
  docs-fresh.  When the I/O contract changes on a bump, the report names the
  **recipes that pin the tool** so they get re-verified before shipping.
  `scripts/io_contracts.py {check,update}`; see `docs/MAINTAINER.md`.
- New reusable `scripts/bump_tools.py`: batch-bump tools to a target version by
  resolving the **real newest build tag** from the image's own registry (quay
  biocontainers / Docker Hub) — filtering out numeric-sort artifact tags
  (kraken2 "2.17", trim-galore "2.3.0" are not real releases) and preferring
  immutable `--<hash>` build tags — then rewriting the YAML + every recipe that
  pins it in lockstep.

### Added — `verify_bump.py`: behaviour-check a bump before it can email you
- The prokka break only surfaced in the *scheduled nightly* (a 3am failure
  email), because the `command -v` capability guard confirms a binary exists but
  not that it *works*.  New `scripts/verify_bump.py` closes that gap: for every
  bumped tool (auto-detected vs `origin/main`, or named) it launches the pinned
  image and runs the tool's **real operation on a tiny generated input**, and for
  any tool used by an e2e-covered recipe it also runs that recipe's full e2e —
  so a prokka-0-CDS-style silent break fails **locally, before you push**.  Wired
  into `bump_tools.py`'s next-steps and documented in `docs/MAINTAINER.md`.
- Verified the current sweep with it: all 29 bumped recipe-used tools behave in
  their pinned images (7 real-op smokes + the rest via the green e2e-9 / liveness
  for DB-gated tools).

### Changed — registry-wide freshness sweep (64 tools bumped to latest)
- Corrected **12 version labels** that disagreed with the pinned image (same
  class as the scanpy 1.10.1-vs-1.7.2 bug: deseq2 1.44→1.50.2, edger, limma,
  clusterProfiler, topGO, methylKit, HOMER, percolator, monocle3, iqtree,
  seurat, InterProScan — bundle images left as-is).
- Bumped **64 tools** to their real newest upstream build (digest-resolved,
  recipes updated in lockstep, I/O contracts re-blessed): e.g. bcftools
  1.21→1.23.1, samtools 1.20→1.23.1, minimap2 2.28→2.31, gatk4 4.6.1→4.6.2,
  spades 4.0→4.2, quast 5.2→5.3, cutadapt 4.9→5.2,
  bakta 1.9.4→1.12.0, busco 5.7.1→6.1.0, seurat 5.0→5.5.1, harmony (harmonypy
  0.0.10→2.0.0), stringtie 2.2.3→3.0.3, multiqc 1.25.1→1.35, and more.
- **Behaviour-changing recipe majors — adopted after CLI-compat verification**:
  Bracken 2.9→3.1 (the `bracken -d -i -o -w -r -l -t` interface the recipe uses
  is unchanged) and medaka 1.11.3→2.2.2 (`medaka_consensus -i -d -o -t -m` intact
  and the recipe's pinned model `r1041_e82_400bps_sup_v5.0.0` still ships — only
  the *default* model moved to v5.2.0).  msconvert is the sole hold-out (its
  upstream tag carries no resolvable version).
- **Prokka held at 1.14.6 (reverted a bad bump).**  The freshness list offered
  `staphb/prokka:1.15.6`, but Prokka has no official release past 1.14.6 (upstream
  is dormant) and that staphb repackage's gene-caller silently emits **0 CDS** —
  the nightly full-pipeline e2e caught it (prokaryote_assembly + pangenome both
  red).  Reverted to 1.14.6 and added a `pin_reason` so the release-watch won't
  re-propose it.  (Exactly the recipe-breaking-bump case the I/O guard is meant
  to flank — here the *nightly e2e* was the backstop, since the break was a
  behaviour change, not an I/O-format change.)

### Added — a path to modern scanpy (self-built, digest-pinned conda-forge image)
- Bioconda froze `scanpy` at 1.7.2, so there's no newer BioContainer.  Added
  `docker/scanpy/Dockerfile` (conda-forge `scanpy=1.12.2` + leidenalg/igraph;
  verified end-to-end on the `scrna_seq` analyze.py — filter → normalize → HVG →
  PCA → neighbors → UMAP → leiden → rank_genes_groups) and a `scanpy-image`
  workflow that builds it, pushes to GHCR, and **repins the registry + recipe to
  the pushed digest** so a modern scanpy stays digest-pinned like any other tool.
  Run the workflow once (then make the GHCR package public) to adopt it.
- New reusable `scripts/repin_tool.py`: re-point a tool to a new image + digest
  across the registry **and** every recipe that pins it, keeping the alignment
  invariant intact in one command.

### Changed — reviewed the 2026-07 update candidates; promoted Panaroo
- The monthly `release_watch` filed four auto-guessed version bumps.  Verified
  each against quay.io (real build-suffixed tag + true digest + the image ships
  the tool):
  - **Panaroo 1.5.0 → 1.8.0** — promoted (real tag `1.8.0--pyhdfd78af_0`, digest
    corrected; not used by any recipe, so no benchmarking needed).
  - **fastp 0.23.4 → 1.3.6** — adopted across the registry **and all 6 recipes
    that pin it** (keeping the "registry image == recipe image" invariant),
    after verifying `fastp v1.3.6` runs the recipe's exact `qc_trim` command on
    real reads (clean FASTQs + JSON + HTML, exit 0).
  - **Salmon 1.10.3 → 2.3.1** — adopted in the registry + `rnaseq_deg` after
    verifying the exact `salmon index` + `salmon quant … -l A --validateMappings`
    commands on a synthetic transcriptome/reads under 2.3.1 (600/600 fragments
    mapped, valid `quant.sf`, exit 0; the `--validateMappings` flag still works).
  - **scanpy 1.12.2** — rejected: Bioconda froze `scanpy` at 1.7.2 (newer
    releases moved to conda-forge), so no `biocontainers/scanpy` image exists
    past 1.7.2 and the candidate tag is not buildable. Also corrected the
    registry entry's stale `version` label (it claimed 1.10.1 while pinning the
    1.7.2 image); the 1.7.2 image runs every scanpy op the `scrna_seq` recipe
    uses. Upgrading scanpy would require stepping outside the digest-pinned
    BioContainers convention (a conda-forge image), so it's left as-is.
  The candidate files' `image_digest` were stale copies of the *old* version's
  digest — promoting them verbatim would have broken the digest pin.  Candidate
  files removed.

### Added — `bioflow cite`: citations + DOIs for the tools you used
- New `bioflow cite <recipe>` / `bioflow cite <tool…>` prints a ready-to-paste
  reference list (or `--format bibtex`) for the tools a recipe runs — mapped
  from each stage's image to the registry citation + a DOI. DOIs are captured
  by the citation fetch (`tool_citations.json`) and verified against the cited
  author/year, so `cite` works offline. (`bioflow.core.citations`.)
- Removed the mis-scoped software-publication artifacts (JOSS `paper/`, the
  paper-build workflow, `CITATION.cff`, the Zenodo maintainer section): bioflow
  is plumbing, so the citation story is about the underlying tools, surfaced by
  `bioflow cite`.

### Added — results overview for germline_variants
- `germline_variants` now has a results harvester (the 3rd recipe wired into the
  overview system): a tidy per-sample table (variant + affected-gene counts from
  the annotated VCF) plus a link to snpEff's own `snpEff_summary.html` report —
  surfaced, not redrawn. Unit-tested with synthetic fixtures.
- Housekeeping: the landing tool count is corrected (113), and the README test
  badge is now a live CI-status badge instead of a hard-coded, drift-prone count.

### Added — citation-integrity guard + tests for the new tooling
- `tests/unit/test_citation_integrity.py` (offline, blocking): the committed
  `tool_citations.json` may only carry unverified PMIDs from a tight
  `KNOWN_UNVERIFIED` allowlist (the 5 tools with no MEDLINE record), and every
  tool citing a PMID must be tracked — so a citation that points at the wrong
  paper can never silently return.
- New unit coverage for the session's fragile helpers: the GenoVi GenBank
  `LOCUS` normaliser/filter (`_GENOME_PLOT_FILTER`, exec'd on a malformed
  fixture), the gen_docs citation columns + leaderboard rendering, and the
  fetch script's accent-insensitive author matching. 687 unit tests pass.

### Added — per-tool citation counts (literature adoption)
- Each registered tool now carries how many papers cite its canonical reference
  — **total** and in the **last 5 full years** (current adoption) — fetched from
  Europe PMC via each tool's registry PMID (unambiguous, unlike name search).
  `scripts/fetch_tool_citations.py` caches the numbers to
  `registry/tool_citations.json`; `gen_docs.py` surfaces them as (a) two columns
  in `docs/reference/tools.md` and (b) a "Most-used tools" leaderboard in
  tools.md + the README. A monthly `tool-citations` workflow refreshes and
  commits them, so normal CI/PRs stay offline. Counts are a lower bound on real
  use and favour older tools; the recent-window column is the fairer signal, and
  tools without a PMID show `n/a`.
- The fetch **verifies** each PMID against the citation's author + year before
  trusting it; a count is published only on a match. This surfaced that **34
  registry citation PMIDs pointed to unrelated papers** (e.g. `flye` → a
  Netrin-1 study, `metabat2` → a career essay). **29 were corrected** to the
  right canonical paper (each re-verified by title + author + year); the
  remaining 5 have no MEDLINE record and show `n/a`.
- The most-used leaderboard is now also on the promo landing page (web), and a
  monthly workflow refreshes counts, docs, README, and landing together.

### Fixed — cache key now tracks module-level constants a stage references
- A stage's cache key hashed only `inspect.getsource(func)`, so editing a
  module-level constant/helper the builder *splices into its command* (e.g. a
  command-template string) did **not** invalidate the cache — a code change
  could silently reuse a stale result, breaking the reproducibility guarantee.
  The key now also includes a digest of the referenced module-level constants
  (str/bytes/number/bool) and same-module helper functions
  (`_referenced_globals_digest`).  Imports from other modules and builtins are
  ignored (pinned by the dependency set).  Regression test added.

### Added — GenoVi circular genome map in prokaryote_assembly
- New `GenoVi` tool (`staphb/genovi:0.4.3`, digest-pinned) + a `genome_plot`
  stage that turns the Prokka annotation into a Circos-style **circular genome
  map** — CDS coloured by COG functional category, GC content and GC skew — a
  publication-style figure that is far more legible than the raw assembly graph.
  The results overview embeds it (the harvester surfaces `genome_plot.png` as
  "Circular genome map (GenoVi)"), and it is now the headline visual on the
  landing page in place of the Bandage graph.
- Publication styling: white background, a colour-blind-safe palette (Okabe-Ito),
  per-track labels and a full genomic-feature + COG colour legend (`-bc/-cs/-te`),
  plus a post-processing pass (Pillow) that numbers each contig by descending
  size — only contigs whose arc is wide enough to read are labelled, so a
  fragmented draft stays uncluttered.
- Robust to Prokka's malformed GenBank `LOCUS` lines: SPAdes' long contig names
  overflow the fixed-width columns and collide the length with the coverage
  field (`…cov_6.882027283413 bp`), which aborts Biopython's strict parser — so
  the stage splits records on `//`, reads the true length from the `length_<N>`
  token, and rewrites each `LOCUS` line to a canonical, parseable form before
  handing the assembly to GenoVi.
- A `min_contig` knob (default 5000) drops the sub-kb fragments Circos chokes
  on; override per run with `--set genome_plot.min_contig=20000` for a cleaner
  figure on very fragmented assemblies.  Best effort: a genome GenoVi cannot
  render never fails the pipeline.  (GenoVi: Cumsille et al. 2023, PMID 37014908.)

### Added — Krona interactive taxonomy chart in metagenomics_profile
- New `Krona` tool (`staphb/krona:2.8.1`, digest-pinned) + a `krona_chart` stage
  that turns the Bracken abundance table into a self-contained interactive
  `krona.html` sunburst — no taxonomy DB needed (it reshapes Bracken with
  cut/paste, then `ktImportText`).  The results overview surfaces it.  Second
  recipe wired into the results system: `bioflow.core.results` is now a small
  per-recipe registry (`_RECIPES`), each with its own tidy table + harvester —
  `prokaryote_assembly` → `assembly_metrics.csv`, `metagenomics_profile` →
  `taxonomic_profile.csv`.  (Krona: Ondov 2011, PMID 21961884.)

### Added — Bandage assembly-graph visualization in prokaryote_assembly
- New `Bandage` tool (`staphb/bandage:0.8.1`, digest-pinned) + a `graph_image`
  stage that renders the SPAdes assembly graph to `assembly_graph.png`
  (headless via `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`).  The results overview **embeds**
  that image per sample — a real, paper-grade assembly-graph picture instead of
  a hand-drawn chart.  First demonstration of the "integrate the field-standard
  viz tool as a stage, then surface its output" pattern (Bandage: Wick 2015,
  PMID 26099265).

### Added — results overview (experimental): tidy data + a report hub
- `bioflow overview <recipe> <workspace>` post-processes a finished run/cohort
  into **Layer 1** tidy data (`results/assembly_metrics.csv` + a `results.json`
  manifest naming the tables + column schema — load it and plot however you
  like) and **Layer 2** `results/overview.html`: a metrics table plus links to
  each tool's *own* report page.  bioflow does NOT redraw plots — it surfaces
  the established, paper-grade reports the pipeline already produces (QUAST
  `report.html` + the Icarus contig browser, fastp QC; MultiQC for the cohort),
  and `results.json` indexes them too.  `prokaryote_assembly` only for now
  (works for single runs and cohorts).  Deep/interactive views stay delegated to
  standard tools (emit BAM/BED/GFF → open in IGV).
- Runs automatically at the end of `bioflow recipe run` and `bioflow cohort`
  (best-effort — a no-op for recipes without a harvester, never fails the run).


### Added — per-run stage parameter overrides (`--set`)
- `bioflow recipe run <recipe> --set <stage>.<param>=<value>` (repeatable)
  tweaks a stage's tunable knobs without editing the recipe — e.g.
  `--set assemble.kmer=21,33,55 --set qc_trim.min_qual=30`.  Only keyword-only
  stage params are targetable (data dependencies stay positional, so an
  override can never collide with one); a `<stage>.<param>` key beats a bare
  `<param>`.  Overrides are applied **before** the cache key + provenance, so
  they invalidate the cache and are recorded — reproducibility is preserved,
  only the value changes.  Also exposed programmatically as
  `set_param_overrides()`.  `prokaryote_assembly` now surfaces `qc_trim.min_qual`
  and `assemble.kmer` as the first tunable parameters (defaults unchanged).

### Added — cohort runner (fan a single-sample recipe across a samplesheet)
- `bioflow cohort <recipe> --samplesheet samples.csv [--jobs N]` runs a
  single-sample recipe (`prokaryote_assembly`, `germline_variants`,
  `metagenomics_profile`, …) once per samplesheet row, each in its own
  `<out>/<sample_id>` workspace, optionally in parallel, then aggregates
  per-sample QC with MultiQC.  Shared options (e.g. `--reference`) apply to
  every sample; per-sample columns override them.  One sample failing records
  the error and the cohort continues (failure isolation).  Each sample runs as
  an isolated `bioflow recipe run` subprocess — the SDK workspace/backend are
  process-global, so subprocess isolation is what makes parallel samples safe.
  Recipes that already loop over a samplesheet internally (`rnaseq_deg`,
  `joint_genotyping`) are not cohort targets.

### Added — Apptainer/Singularity execution backend (run on HPC, no Docker daemon)
- New `SingularityBackend` runs each stage via `apptainer exec [--nv]
  --cleanenv --bind <host>:<ctr> --pwd <workdir> docker://<image> sh -c …`,
  so bioflow works on the many HPC clusters that ship Apptainer but forbid
  the Docker daemon.  BioContainers are pulled over the docker transport and
  cached as SIFs.
- `make_backend()` factory selects the backend from `BIOFLOW_BACKEND`
  (`docker` default / `podman` / `singularity` / `apptainer`); `run_plan`,
  the SDK runtime, and MultiQC now route through it.  Binary auto-resolves
  `apptainer` → `singularity`, overridable with `BIOFLOW_APPTAINER_BIN`.
- CPU/RAM are advisory for this backend (the job scheduler enforces them on
  a cluster) — a future SlurmBackend will translate them into `sbatch`
  directives.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-29

### Added — image-capability guard (catches "wrong image" bugs)
- New `tests/integration/test_image_capabilities.py`: for every recipe
  stage it renders the command, extracts the binaries it invokes, and
  asserts each one exists in that stage's image (`docker run <image> sh
  -c 'command -v …'`, keeping the image's entrypoint so conda-activation
  containers still resolve their `PATH`).  This is the guard that would have
  caught the 0.3.0 samtools breakage immediately — it needs no databases
  or fixtures, only that the tools are present.  Runs as its own nightly
  job with `BIOFLOW_PRUNE_IMAGES=1` to keep disk bounded.
- The guard is wrapper-aware: for `wine <tool>` stages it checks both that
  `wine` is on `PATH` and that the wrapped `<tool>.exe` actually ships in
  the image (located on disk, no wine runtime) — so it can't be fooled into
  passing on the wrapper alone while the real tool is missing.

### Fixed — ChIP/ATAC dedup also needed samtools (found by the guard)
- The guard immediately surfaced one the 0.3.0 fix missed: `chip_seq` /
  `atac_seq` `dedup` ran `picard MarkDuplicates && samtools index` in the
  **picard** image, which ships no samtools.  Replaced the `samtools
  index` with Picard's own `CREATE_INDEX=true` (verified it writes the
  `.bai`), so the stage needs only picard.

### Fixed — proteomics_dda msconvert must run under wine (found by the guard)
- The full guard run flagged a third one: `proteomics_dda` `msconvert`
  called `msconvert` directly, but the ProteoWizard image ships it only
  as `/wineprefix64/.../msconvert.exe` (no `msconvert` on `PATH`) — so
  the stage would have died with `command not found`.  Now invokes it as
  `wine msconvert …`, the image's documented entry point (`wine` is at
  `/usr/bin/wine`, verified).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed — aligner images had no samtools (5 recipes broke at alignment)
The plain single-tool aligner BioContainers (`bwa`, `bowtie2`,
`minimap2`) do **not** bundle samtools, yet five recipes ran
`aligner | samtools sort` / `samtools index` inside them — so every one
failed at its alignment stage with `samtools: command not found`.  The
smoke matrix only exercises each recipe's *first* stage, so this stayed
invisible.  (See #2.)  Each aligner stage now uses an image that carries
both tools:
- **germline_variants**, **joint_genotyping**: a mulled
  `bwa 0.7.19 + samtools 1.22` image.  A new **`prepare_reference`**
  stage builds the BWA index + `.fai` + `.dict` **once** (in the cohort
  recipe, before the per-sample fan-out — previously each parallel
  sample raced to index the *shared* reference), and the gatk call stage
  drops its own `samtools` calls (`MarkDuplicates --CREATE_INDEX`
  indexes the dedup BAM; the gatk4 image ships no samtools either).
  Verified end-to-end on phiX: prep → bwa-mem → sort/index →
  MarkDuplicates → HaplotypeCaller now produces a valid VCF.
- **chip_seq**, **atac_seq**: `staphb/bowtie2:2.5.4` (bundles samtools).
- **metagenome_assembly**: a mulled `minimap2 2.31 + samtools 1.23` image.
- `registry/tools/alignment/bowtie2.yaml` had the same broken
  assumption (and `samtools.yaml` documented it as fact) — both fixed.

### Fixed — static audit of the never-e2e'd recipes (round 1)
A static pass over the 10 recipes that have no committed full-e2e fixture
(they need external reference data) turned up several latent defects:
- **proteomics_dda**: the percolator FDR cut used ``awk -F\t``, whose
  backslash bash strips before awk sees it — so the field separator
  became the literal letter ``t`` instead of a tab, and
  ``passing_psms.tsv`` was filtered on garbage columns.  Now ``-F"\t"``,
  which reaches awk as a real tab (verified).
- **eukaryote_assembly**: the docstring advertised ``polish=False`` to
  skip Medaka for HiFi reads, but no such parameter existed.  Added it
  (the ``polish`` stage is renamed ``polish_consensus`` to free the
  name); ``assess`` already falls back to Flye's ``assembly.fasta``.
- **chip_seq**: docstring promised ``--ctrl-r1 / --ctrl-r2`` raw-control
  alignment the recipe never implemented — corrected to document the
  actual ``--ctrl-bam`` (pre-aligned control) input.
- **metagenomics_profile**: ``bioflow db fetch`` example used a
  catalog key that doesn't exist (``kraken2_standard`` →
  ``kraken2_standard_8gb``) and now notes Bracken's ``kmer_distrib`` need.

### Docs — strict build fixed + e2e-coverage page
- `mkdocs build --strict` was aborting: three docs links pointed at repo
  files outside the `docs/` tree (`conda-recipe/meta.yaml`,
  `scripts/compare_nfcore.py`, the nf-core workflow), which strict mode
  flags as unresolved.  Re-pointed them at GitHub blob URLs.
- New **`reference/e2e-coverage.md`** documents which 9 recipes have a
  committed full end-to-end fixture and which 10 are gated on external
  reference data (with the `bioflow db fetch` key for each), plus the one
  utility recipe.  Regenerated `reference/recipes.md` / `tools.md` from
  the registry (now 20 recipes; `joint_genotyping` was missing and image
  tags were stale).

### Fixed — ani_matrix broken for genomes outside the workspace
- **Bug a full e2e caught**: FastANI reads genome paths from a *list
  file*, not the command, so the SDK's command-path translator and
  auto-mount never applied to them — every external genome failed with
  `Could not open <host path>`.  Since genomes normally live outside the
  output workspace, this broke the recipe's primary documented use.
- New SDK helper **`stage_input(path)`** copies an external file into the
  active workspace (always mounted at `/work`) and returns its container
  path — the clean primitive for any recipe that feeds a tool a list
  file of paths.  Also exported **`container_path(path)`**.
- `ani_matrix` now stages genomes via `stage_input` and writes container
  paths into the FastANI list; verified end-to-end (genome1 vs genome2 =
  99.5% ANI).

### Added — full e2e for the comparative-genomics recipes
- `tests/integration/test_full_pipeline_e2e.py` gains real end-to-end
  tests for **amr_vf_catalogue** (ABRicate fan-out, bundled DBs),
  **ani_matrix** (all-vs-all FastANI), **pangenome** (Prokka × N →
  Roary), and **gwas** (Scoary on a synthetic Roary GPA + phenotype,
  recovers a planted association).  Fixtures:
  `data/test/genomes_small/` (phiX174 + a 25-SNP variant) and
  `data/test/gwas_small/` (12-gene × 10-sample GPA).  Recipes validated
  end-to-end: 1 (prokaryote) → 9 (see below).
- **cafe_evolution** (CAFE5 gene-family expansion/contraction) added as
  the 6th, on `data/test/cafe_small/` (ultrametric 4-taxon tree + 60
  families).
- **phylogeny** (single-copy core → MAFFT × N → IQ-TREE) added as the
  7th, on `data/test/phylo_small/` (Prokka GFF + CDS + Roary GPA for 4
  phiX strains; IQ-TREE recovers a 4-taxon ML tree).
- **rnaseq_deg** (fastp → Salmon → DESeq2 → enrichment + MultiQC) added
  as the 8th, on `data/test/rnaseq_small/` (60 synthetic transcripts, 4
  samples, 10 transcripts planted ~4× up in the treated group).  DESeq2
  recovers the planted signal (`tx0001` log2FC ≈ 2) and the run finishes
  in seconds.  The sample sheet is built by the test at run time so no
  machine-specific paths are committed.
- **methylation_wgbs** (TrimGalore → Bismark → methylKit) added as the
  9th, on `data/test/methyl_small/` (phiX174 + 3,000 synthetic
  directional bisulfite read pairs, ~70 % CpG-methylated).  The reads
  map at 100 % and Bismark produces a real cytosine report; the genome
  is **not** committed pre-prepared — the new `bismark_prep` stage
  (below) bisulfite-converts it at run time, so no version-tied bowtie2
  index lands in git.  Regenerated deterministically by
  `scripts/gen_methyl_fixture.py`.

### Added — methylation_wgbs prepares its genome (matches the docs)
- The recipe's docstring promised automatic genome preparation, but the
  pipeline had no such stage — it silently required a pre-prepared
  `Bisulfite_Genome/` directory, so running from a plain reference FASTA
  failed.  A new **`bismark_prep`** stage now runs
  `bismark_genome_preparation` when `--bismark-genome` is a FASTA (or a
  directory holding one); an already-prepared directory is detected and
  used directly, skipping preparation.  `methylation_wgbs` is now 4
  stages (trim → bismark_prep → bismark → methylkit).

### Fixed — methylKit CpG-report glob (shell ate the regex escape)
- `methylkit_dmr` matched the cytosine report with `pattern='…txt(\.gz)?$'`,
  but the `\.` escape was stripped by the shell before R parsed the
  string, so R aborted with *"'\.' is an unrecognized escape in character
  string"* and the whole recipe failed at the final stage.  Replaced with
  a `[.]` character class (no backslash to escape), which matches the
  report — with or without a `.gz` suffix — robustly.

### Fixed — rnaseq_deg DESeq2 step (two latent bugs)
- The `deseq2_diff` stage required **tximport**, which the
  `bioconductor-deseq2` BioContainer does not ship — every run failed
  with "there is no package called 'tximport'".  Rewritten to assemble
  the count matrix in base R straight from each sample's `quant.sf`
  (`NumReads`, rounded) and feed `DESeqDataSetFromMatrix`, dropping the
  tximport dependency entirely.
- A second, masked bug: `samples$sample_id` inside the `Rscript -e "…"`
  body (run via `sh -c`) was shell-expanded because the `$` was
  unescaped, so the `file.path(...)` of `quant.sf` paths was wrong.
  Escaped to `\$sample_id`.  The pipeline now also **fails fast** if the
  DESeq2 stage exits non-zero (the downstream Enrichr step tolerates an
  empty gene list, which previously masked a broken DEG table).

### Fixed — LF line endings for container-read fixtures
- A new `.gitattributes` pins text test fixtures (and registry YAMLs) to
  LF.  CAFE5 doesn't strip a trailing CR, so a CRLF checkout on Windows
  made it read the last species column as `D\r` and fail with "D was not
  found in gene family …".  FASTA parsers tolerated the CR, but the
  table parser did not — LF is now enforced so fixtures are safe on
  every host.

### Fixed — bounded stdout retention (no orchestrator OOM on chatty tools)
- `DockerBackend.run` accumulated **every** stdout line in memory; a
  tool that emits millions of lines (Roary, IQ-TREE) could OOM the
  orchestrator.  It now retains only the trailing `_STDOUT_TAIL_LINES`
  (5000) via a bounded `deque` for the diagnostic `CommandResult.stdout`
  — every line still streams live to `log_callback`, and real artifacts
  go to files in the workspace.
- Tests: +1 (`test_docker_timeout.py`) asserting the tail is kept.

### Fixed — clear error for shell-unsafe external input filenames
- An external input file whose **basename** contained a space or shell
  metacharacter silently corrupted the recipe's command — bioflow mounts
  the file's parent at the space-free `/inputs/<n>` and splices the
  basename in unquoted, and it can't be quoted generically because many
  recipes wrap the whole command in `bash -c '…'`.  (A spaced *directory*
  was already fine — only the basename survives into the command.)
- `_collect_external_mounts` now raises an actionable `ValueError`
  naming the offending characters and telling the user to rename /
  symlink to a safe name.
- Tests: +12 (`tests/unit/test_unsafe_paths.py`), incl. confirmation
  that spaced *directories* and workspace-internal paths are unaffected.

### Fixed — stage_timeout now actually bounds runtime
- **Latent bug**: `run_plan(stage_timeout=…)` never worked.  The log
  loop (`container.logs(stream=True, follow=True)`) blocks until the
  container exits, so the subsequent `container.wait(timeout=…)` — a
  docker-py HTTP read timeout, not a runtime cap — could never fire for
  a runaway container; it would hang forever.
- `DockerBackend.run` now starts a watchdog `threading.Timer` that
  `container.kill()`s the stage when the timeout elapses, returning the
  conventional exit code **124** with a clear message.
- Tests: +3 (`tests/unit/test_docker_timeout.py`, fake-container based,
  deterministic).

### Fixed — DockerBackend now clamps CPU/RAM to host capacity
- **Bug the full-pipeline e2e caught**: a stage declaring `cpu=8` (e.g.
  SPAdes in `prokaryote_assembly`) failed to even *start* on any host
  with fewer cores — Docker rejects a container whose `--cpus` exceeds
  the host count ("range of CPUs is from 0.01 to N.00"), so all 3 retry
  attempts died instantly.  Passed locally (12 cores) but failed on the
  4-core CI runner — and would hit any user on a small workstation.
- `DockerBackend.run` now clamps the requested CPU to the host core count
  and RAM to ~90% of host memory (`_clamp_resources`), so an
  over-ambitious resource request degrades to "use what's available"
  instead of crashing.
- Tests: +5 (`tests/unit/test_resource_clamp.py`).

### Added — first full-pipeline end-to-end test
- `tests/integration/test_full_pipeline_e2e.py`: runs the **entire**
  `prokaryote_assembly` recipe (fastp → SPAdes → QUAST → Prokka) against
  real BioContainers — the first time a complete pipeline (not just a
  first stage, as the smoke matrix does) is validated end-to-end.
- New `data/test/phix_small/` fixture: phiX174 (`NC_001422.1`, 5386 bp) +
  1000 wgsim-simulated 150 bp pairs (~56×, seed 42 → deterministic).
  phiX assembles into a single ~5.4 kb contig in <1 min, so the whole
  chain finishes in ~45 s.
- Asserts real data flow: assembled contig length 4.5–6 kb, QUAST
  `report.tsv`, and Prokka annotation with ≥1 CDS.  Verified locally
  (phiX → 1 contig 5377 bp, 6 CDS).
- Wired into the nightly-smoke workflow as a second step.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-12

> **Why upgrade from 0.2.0**: the `v0.2.0` tag predated the registry
> freshness fix, so the 0.2.0 wheel bundled a registry whose
> `quay.io/biocontainers/*` tags had been garbage-collected from Quay —
> `rnaseq_deg`, `chip_seq`, `atac_seq`, `eukaryote_assembly`,
> `metagenome_assembly`, and others would fail at run time with "image
> not found".  **0.2.1 ships the repaired, 107/107-pinned registry**, so
> recipes actually pull their containers.  Everything below landed after
> the 0.2.0 cut and is new to PyPI users here.

### Changed — nightly smoke matrix expanded (3 → 5 recipes)
- Added real-container smoke cases for **chip_seq** (TrimGalore — a
  container family shared by chip/atac/methylation, previously
  unexercised) and **germline_variants** (validates the variant recipe's
  fastp wiring).  All five pass against real BioContainers locally
  (~90 s) — more of the "522 mostly-mock tests" critique closed with
  genuine end-to-end coverage.

### Changed — mypy type-checking is now blocking
- Fixed all 33 mypy errors across 7 modules (Rich `TaskID` optionals in
  the progress bars, `dict[str, Any]` run kwargs, anthropic/openai/docker
  SDK union + missing-stub noise, a loop-variable shadow in
  `cli/update.py`).  `mypy bioflow --ignore-missing-imports` now reports
  **0 errors**.
- CI's `typecheck` job drops `continue-on-error` — a new type error now
  fails the build, closing the "advisory only" gap.

### Added — nf-core concordance benchmark (harness + methodology)
- `scripts/compare_nfcore.py` (new, stdlib-only): scores agreement
  between a bioflow output and the matching nf-core output —
  **Jaccard + genotype concordance** on normalised VCF sites
  (vs nf-core/sarek), and **Spearman ρ** of per-gene counts
  (vs nf-core/rnaseq).  Optional `--min-jaccard` / `--min-rho` gate for
  CI.
- `docs/benchmarks/nfcore-concordance.md`: golden datasets
  (GIAB HG002 chr20; nf-core/rnaseq chr22), method, and initial
  acceptance thresholds.
- `.github/workflows/nfcore-concordance.yml`: manually-dispatched job
  (not a per-PR gate — a full run needs staged references).
- Honesty note: bioflow ships the *scoring* half (committed + tested);
  the *production* half (running both pipelines on a machine with the
  references) is operator-run and documented.
- Tests: +13 (`tests/unit/test_compare_nfcore.py`).

### Added — GPU passthrough + Podman runtime
- `@stage(..., gpu=True)` (and a tool YAML's `resources.gpu`) now attach
  all host GPUs to that stage's container via a Docker `DeviceRequest`
  (the API equivalent of `--gpus all`); needs the NVIDIA Container
  Toolkit, and degrades to a warning on CPU-only hosts rather than
  failing.  Threaded through `Stage`, the `@stage` decorator, and the
  preset `run_plan` path.
- `DockerBackend` works with **Podman**: it honours `BIOFLOW_DOCKER_HOST`
  / `DOCKER_HOST` (point it at the Podman API socket) and an optional
  `base_url`, and reads `BIOFLOW_CONTAINER_RUNTIME`.
- `bioflow doctor` recognises Podman as a Docker alternative — the
  `docker_cli` / `docker_daemon` checks fall back to `podman` and report
  which runtime they found.
- Tests: +10 (`tests/unit/test_gpu_podman.py`).  Backend `run()` gains a
  `gpu` kwarg (the `ContainerBackend` protocol + MockBackend updated).

### Added — reference-DB catalog expansion + refgenie manifest
- `bioflow/core/db.py` catalog gains the references real recipes need:
  GATK known-sites `dbsnp_grch38` + `mills_indels_grch38` (BQSR/VQSR),
  `encode_blacklist_grch38` (ChIP/ATAC peak filtering), and
  `gencode_grch38` (STAR/Salmon/featureCounts annotation).
- Catalog entries now carry `genome` + `asset` tags, and a new
  `refgenie_manifest()` / `bioflow db manifest` emits a
  [refgenie](https://refgenie.databio.org/)-compatible JSON mapping
  `<genome>/<asset>` → catalogued DB, so labs already standardised on
  refgenie can see which existing assets satisfy a bioflow requirement.
- Tests: +5 (`tests/unit/test_db.py`).

### Added — rnaseq_deg depth: GO enrichment + MultiQC
- `rnaseq_deg` extended from 4 → 6 stages:
  - **`enrich_go`** — GO enrichment on the significant DEGs via gseapy's
    Enrichr query.  Symbol-based, so no organism-specific OrgDb package
    is needed; an awk numeric-regex guard on the `padj` column avoids the
    classic "NA-treated-as-0" false positive.
  - **`multiqc_report`** — aggregates every per-sample fastp + Salmon
    report into a single MultiQC HTML.
- DAG-shape test updated; recipe still runs end-to-end under MockBackend.

### Added — `joint_genotyping` recipe (GATK cohort best practice)
- New 7-stage recipe (`bioflow/recipes/variant_calling/joint_genotyping.py`)
  implementing the canonical GATK **joint-genotyping** workflow for
  cohorts, where `germline_variants` only does single-sample direct
  calling:
  - **per sample (fan-out)**: fastp → BWA-MEM → MarkDuplicates →
    HaplotypeCaller `-ERC GVCF`
  - **cohort (converge)**: CombineGVCFs → GenotypeGVCFs →
    best-practice hard filtering (separate SNP / INDEL filters) → SnpEff
- Takes a `sample_id,fastq_r1,fastq_r2` sample sheet and uses `.starmap`
  to run the per-sample stages in parallel before converging on the
  joint steps — the production pattern reviewers expect for population
  and family studies, and a worked example of bioflow's fan-out.
- Recipe count 19 → 20 (12 per-pipeline).  Tests: +3 (registration, DAG
  shape, MockBackend e2e).

### Added — run provenance (RO-Crate + PROV-style JSON)
- `bioflow/core/provenance.py` (new): every recipe run records, per
  stage, the container **image + content digest**, the exact
  **command**, every **input file's SHA-256 + size**, **start/end**
  timestamps, exit code, and the bioflow version.
- At the end of a run the workspace gains two self-describing files:
  - `provenance.json` — flat, human-readable run record
  - `ro-crate-metadata.json` — an [RO-Crate 1.1](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/)
    research object (the de-facto packaging standard for computational
    workflow runs), so the output directory is consumable by reviewers
    and downstream tools directly.
- Wired into `bioflow recipe run` (on by default; `--no-provenance` to
  skip).  Opt-in and **zero-cost when off** — the SDK hot path pays
  nothing unless a recorder is installed, and provenance errors degrade
  to warnings rather than aborting the science.
- New `bioflow provenance show <workspace>` command (+ `--json`) renders
  the recorded run: per-stage image, pinned digest, exit status, and
  input hashes.  Builds directly on the digest-pinning work — pinned
  tools show their `sha256:…` in the provenance.
- Tests: +14 (`tests/unit/test_provenance.py`); verified end-to-end
  against real Docker (digest resolved from the local image, RO-Crate
  validates structurally).

### Fixed — registry freshness (stale BioContainer tags)
- **Discovery**: an audit during digest-pinning found that ~half the
  registry's `quay.io/biocontainers/*` image tags had 404'd.  Quay
  rotates each package's `--<buildhash>_<n>` build suffix and garbage-
  collects the old ones, so dozens of recipes (chip_seq, atac_seq,
  eukaryote_assembly, metagenome_assembly, rnaseq_deg's Salmon stage,
  …) would have failed at run time with "image not found" — unrelated
  to the user's data.
- `scripts/refresh_tags.py` (new): audits every Quay BioContainer
  reference, and with `--apply` rewrites any dead tag to the newest
  *same-version* build (never changing the upstream software version).
  Non-Quay images and versions that have left Quay entirely are
  reported for manual review.
- Applied: **34 registry tool YAMLs** + **7 recipe-hardcoded images**
  (bowtie2, bracken, flye, macs3, medaka, metabat2, tobias) re-pointed
  to live tags.  Salmon's `1.10.3--hb950928_0` → `1.10.3--h45fbf2d_5`
  fixed separately (it broke the rnaseq_deg quant stage).
- Verified: the bumped images pull + run (e.g. `bowtie2 2.5.4`), and
  the nightly smoke matrix is green.

### Added — full digest pinning (registry now 100% content-addressed)
- Digest coverage raised from 5/110 → **107/107 active tools** in two
  passes.  The second pass resolved the 17 hold-outs:
  - **Version bumps** to the newest BioContainer of the same tool where
    the pinned version had left Quay: DESeq2 1.44→1.50.2, edgeR
    4.2→4.8.2, limma 3.60→3.66, clusterProfiler 4.12→4.18.4, topGO
    2.56→2.62, HOMER 4.11.1→5.1, Scanpy 1.10.1→1.7.2 (1.10 was never on
    Quay biocontainers), Comet 2024020→2026011, Percolator 3.06.1→3.7.1,
    InterProScan 5.67→5.59.
  - **Image-source switches**: methylKit and monocle3 moved off the
    multi-GB `bioconductor/bioconductor_full:RELEASE_3_18` (gone) to the
    dedicated `bioconductor-methylkit` / `r-monocle3` BioContainers;
    Cell Ranger tag `7.2.0`→`v7.2.0`; Seurat `5.0.1`→`5.0.0`.
  - **Deprecations**: MaxQuant joins MSFragger + FragPipe as
    `deprecated: true` — proprietary tools whose images are gone and
    which the `proteomics_dda` recipe does not use (it runs the
    open-source msconvert → Comet → Percolator stack).  The audit now
    skips deprecated tools.
- **CI `digest-audit` is now blocking** (was advisory): every active
  tool must carry an `image_digest`, so the registry can never silently
  rot again.
- `scripts/refresh_tags.py` also reports `version_gone` and non-Quay
  images for these manual cases.

### Added — Bioconda recipe (prep)
- `conda-recipe/meta.yaml`: noarch-python Bioconda recipe (only
  bioflow's pure-Python stack is a conda dep; tools run as Docker
  containers).  Submission walkthrough in `docs/MAINTAINER.md` Part 7.
  Gated on the real-PyPI publish (the recipe sources the PyPI sdist).

### Changed — CI
- All workflows opt into the Node 24 runtime
  (`FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24`) ahead of the 2026-06-16 forced
  switch, silencing the Node 20 deprecation warnings.

### Fixed — nightly smoke
- `rnaseq_deg.qc_one` smoke assertion matched the stage's real output
  names (`<sample_id>_R1.clean.fq.gz`), fixing a false CI failure.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-05

First PyPI release.  Three months of 0.1.x work consolidated into a
single installable distribution + SemVer commitment.

> **PyPI distribution name**: ``bioflowkit``.  The namespace ``bioflow``
> was taken in 2018 by an unrelated dormant project, so we ship under
> ``bioflowkit`` on PyPI.  Everything else stays the same — Python
> ``from bioflow import stage`` still works, the ``bioflow`` CLI
> command is unchanged, and the repository remains
> ``github.com/hope9901/bioflow``.  Only the ``pip install`` argument
> reflects the alternate name.

### Added — `bioflow doctor`
- New CLI command + `bioflow.core.doctor` module: 12-point host
  self-check covering Python version, architecture, Docker CLI/daemon/
  socket, CPU/RAM/disk floors, GPU presence, registry loadability,
  `~/.bioflow/` writability, and workspace writability.
- Every check is independent and never raises — failures become
  `CheckResult(status="fail", fix="…")` so the rest of the report still
  runs.  Exit code is 1 when any check fails (warnings do not block).
- `--json` emits a structured `{summary, checks[]}` payload for CI;
  `--verbose` adds per-check detail blocks.
- README + `docs/install.md` updated to make `bioflow doctor` the first
  command a new user runs.
- Tests: +26 unit tests (`tests/unit/test_doctor.py`) covering each
  check + the CLI surface.

### Added — Container digest pinning
- `registry/schema.yaml`: optional `container.image_digest` field
  (pattern `^sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}$`).
- `bioflow.core.registry.ContainerSpec.pinned_image` returns
  `image@digest` when a digest is pinned; runner now passes that ref
  to the backend so silent upstream retags can't change recipe results.
- `scripts/pin_digests.py` resolves digests via `docker buildx
  imagetools inspect` (fallback: `docker manifest inspect`, then
  `docker pull`) and writes them back into YAML in-place, preserving
  comments via ruamel.yaml.  `--audit`, `--dry-run`, `--force`
  supported.
- CI adds an advisory `digest-audit` job that surfaces the
  pinned/unpinned count without failing the build (flip when bulk
  pinning is done).
- 5 high-traffic tools pinned in-tree (fastp / spades / quast / prokka /
  bwa) as a demonstration.
- Tests: +10 unit tests (`tests/unit/test_digest_pinning.py`) covering
  `pinned_image` semantics, schema validation, runner integration, and
  a live-registry regression guard.

### Added — Nightly recipe smoke matrix
- `tests/integration/test_recipe_smoke_matrix.py`: parametrized
  per-recipe smoke test that drives the lightest reachable stage of
  each recipe against a real BioContainer (fastp on the ecoli_small
  fixture, abricate on the bundled reference FASTA, …).  Each entry
  asserts the container exited 0 and produced expected output files.
- `.github/workflows/nightly-smoke.yml`: schedule = `0 3 * * *`,
  Docker-enabled ubuntu runner, uploads JUnit XML.
- README gains a "nightly smoke" badge.

### Added — `bioflow run --resume` / `--fresh` + `bioflow status`
- `bioflow run` already auto-skipped checkpointed stages; this exposes
  the behaviour with explicit `--resume` (alias for default) and
  `--fresh` (delete `.bioflow_state.json` and re-run from scratch).
  Mutually exclusive.
- New `bioflow status <workdir>` command: human report or `--json` for
  completed_stages / failed_stages / artifacts.
- Tests: +7 unit tests (`tests/unit/test_run_resume.py`) — fault
  injection mid-pipeline, resume skips completed stages, `--fresh`
  re-runs all, and CLI status surface (empty / partial / JSON).

### Changed — Internal layout (no public API changes)
- `bioflow/sdk.py` (1278 lines, one file) → `bioflow/sdk/` package with
  9 focused modules: `_runtime` (workspace/backend globals), `_cache`
  (toggles + sentinel), `_hashing`, `_paths` (host↔container path
  translation + external bind mounts), `_parallel` (worker count +
  progress + retry bumps), `_result` (StageResult), `_stage` (Stage +
  fan-out + `@stage` decorator), `_pipeline` (Pipeline + `@pipeline`),
  `__init__` re-exports the public surface and the underscore-prefixed
  helpers the test suite still references.  Largest single file
  shrinks from 1278 → 522 lines.
- `bioflow/cli.py` (1417 lines) → `bioflow/cli/` package: `_app`
  (typer app + console + encoding bootstrap), per-command modules
  `hw`, `pipelines` (recommend/custom/run/status), `db`, `update`,
  `ncbi`, `recipe` (also owns `_parse_recipe_extra`), `llm`, `doctor`,
  `setup`.  `__init__` imports each module to trigger `@app.command`
  registration and re-exports `app` + `_parse_recipe_extra` for
  backwards compatibility.  Largest single file now 318 lines
  (`cli/update.py`).
- New `bioflow/cli/__main__.py` keeps `python -m bioflow.cli` working
  alongside the existing `bioflow` console-script entry point.
- Verified: 565 unit tests still pass, ruff clean, `bioflow doctor`
  reports 12/12 ok on the dev host.

### Added — PyPI distribution
- First release published to PyPI as ``bioflow``.  ``pip install
  bioflow`` now works from any directory, with the 110-tool registry +
  14 preset YAMLs bundled inside the wheel
  (`bioflow/_bundled_registry/`).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: tag-driven (`v*.*.*`) release
  pipeline — build → TestPyPI → PyPI → GitHub Release — using PyPI
  Trusted Publishing (OIDC) so no long-lived tokens live in the repo.
  Build step refuses to publish when `pyproject.toml::project.version`
  and `bioflow.__version__` disagree, and verifies the wheel ships
  `bioflow/sdk/`, `bioflow/cli/`, and `bioflow/_bundled_registry/`.
- `docs/MAINTAINER.md`: PyPI Trusted Publisher setup walkthrough +
  release procedure (tag, monitor, hotfix).

### Bumps
- Version: 0.1.14 → 0.2.0 (SemVer commitment starts here).

### Tests
- 522 → 565 (+43): doctor (+26), digest pinning (+10), resume (+7).

---

## [0.1.14] — 2026-05-15

### Added — documentation site (MkDocs → GitHub Pages)
- `mkdocs.yml` (Material theme) + `docs/` pages: index, install,
  quickstart, architecture, on top of the existing MAINTAINER /
  UPDATE_CADENCES / DESIGN docs.
- `scripts/gen_docs.py` — auto-generates `docs/reference/tools.md`
  (110 tools by category) and `docs/reference/recipes.md` (19 recipes
  with their DAGs) from the registry so the published docs never drift.
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` — regenerates the reference pages,
  builds with `mkdocs build --strict`, and deploys to GitHub Pages on
  push to main (official actions/deploy-pages flow).
- `[project.optional-dependencies].docs` = mkdocs + mkdocs-material.
- README links to https://hope9901.github.io/bioflow/.

### Note
- Enable Pages once in the repo settings (Settings → Pages → Source:
  GitHub Actions) for the first deploy to publish.

### Bumps
- Version: 0.1.13 → 0.1.14

---

## [0.1.13] — 2026-05-15

### Added — real-data validation + distribution (TIER 1-B & TIER 2)

**First real-biology validation** (was: MockBackend + alpine only)
- `data/test/ecoli_small/real_R{1,2}.fastq.gz` — 500 high-quality
  paired reads (Phred 40), a third carrying adapters.
- `tests/integration/test_recipe_real_data.py` — pulls the real
  fastp BioContainer and runs it on the fixture: 1000 reads in,
  >800 survive, valid JSON report.  Also runs the
  `prokaryote_assembly` recipe's qc_trim stage against real Docker.
  **First time an actual bioinformatics tool has been validated
  end-to-end through the SDK.**

**Distribution**
- The bioflow self-image builds + runs:
  `docker build -f docker/core/Dockerfile -t bioflow .` →
  `docker run bioflow recipe list` shows all 19 recipes (~1 GB).
- **Fixed `pip install` deployment blocker**: the registry resolved as
  `./registry` relative to CWD, so a wheel install with no git checkout
  had no registry.  Now:
  - `pyproject.toml` force-includes `registry/` into the wheel as
    `bioflow/_bundled_registry` (110 tool YAMLs + presets + schema).
  - `bioflow.core.registry.default_registry_dir()` prefers `./registry`
    (dev) and falls back to the bundled copy.
  - Verified: clean-venv `pip install`, then `bioflow tools` from `C:\`
    lists all 110 tools and 19 recipes.
- `python -m build` + `twine check` PASS for sdist and wheel.

### Tests
- 519 → 522 (+3 registry-resolver unit tests).
- Integration: +2 real-fastp tests (Docker-gated).

### Bumps
- Version: 0.1.12 → 0.1.13 (synced stale `bioflow.__version__`).

---

## [0.1.12] — 2026-05-15

### Added — variant-calling pipeline (new category)
- New schema category `variant_calling` + `bioflow/pipelines/variant_calling.py`
- 4 new tools: `gatk4`, `bcftools`, `snpeff`, `freebayes`
- New recipe **`germline_variants`**:
  fastp → BWA-MEM → GATK MarkDuplicates+HaplotypeCaller →
  bcftools filter → SnpEff annotation.
  Fills the single largest workflow gap (resequencing / SNP calling).

### Added — recipes that use the 0.1.10/0.1.11 tools
Previously 30+ assembly / binning / polishing tools were registered but
unreachable from any one-liner.  Two new recipes wire them in:
- **`eukaryote_assembly`** — NanoPlot → Flye → Medaka → compleasm
  (long-read ONT/HiFi eukaryote assembly + polish + BUSCO QC)
- **`metagenome_assembly`** — fastp → MEGAHIT → minimap2 → MetaBAT2 →
  CheckM2 (metagenome assembly + genome binning + bin QC)

### Verified
- All 4 variant-calling images resolve via T1 freshness (no yanked).
- 3 new recipes execute end-to-end through MockBackend.

### Tests
- 510 → 519 (+9): 3 new e2e execution tests, 2 new DAG-shape entries,
  registry-total raised to ≥19.

### Bumps
- Tool count: 106 → 110 · Recipe count: 16 → 19 · Categories: 15 → 16
- Version: 0.1.11 → 0.1.12

---

## [0.1.11] — 2026-05-15

### Added — 30 tools across 11 pipeline categories (76 → 106)

Filling the largest gaps so every pipeline can be assembled from the
registry without inventing inline images.  Headline fix: a recipe
no longer needs to inline `quay.io/biocontainers/multiqc:…` or
`bedtools:…` — these are now real registry entries that
`bioflow tools` lists and `bioflow update auto` tracks.

**QC (3):** multiqc · cutadapt · seqkit
**Alignment (3):** minimap2 · bwa · bedtools
**Assembly QC (2):** compleasm · gfastats
**Struct. annotation (2):** augustus · liftoff
**Functional annotation (3):** antismash · gtdbtk · dbcan
**RNA-seq align/quant (3):** subread (featureCounts) · stringtie · rsem
**Enrichment (3):** gseapy · topgo · enrichr
**scRNA-seq (3):** bustools · scrublet · harmony
**Metagenomics (2):** metabat2 · maxbin2
**Epigenomics (1):** methylpy
**Comparative genomics (3):** panaroo · mash · skani
**Proteomics (2):** openms · xtandem

### Verified
- T1 freshness ran against all 30 → **30/30 image references resolve**
  (initial `xtandem` had wrong BioContainers package name; corrected
  to `xtandem` not `tandem`).
- Every tool with an active GitHub repo declares `source_repo:` so T2
  weekly release-watch covers them automatically.

### Fixed
- `days_since_last_candidate` / `days_since_last_t3_run` clamp to 0
  when filesystem clock skew yields a sub-second-in-the-future mtime
  on Windows.

### Bumps
- Tool count: 76 → 106
- Version: 0.1.10 → 0.1.11

---

## [0.1.10] — 2026-05-15

### Added — 12 genome assembly tools (64 → 76 registered)

Filling out the assembly category beyond the original 4 (SPAdes,
hifiasm, Flye, Unicycler):

**Long-read assemblers (4):**
- `canu`        — classic long-read assembler with `-pacbio-hifi`
- `verkko`      — T2T-quality HiFi + ONT hybrid (Rautiainen 2023)
- `nextdenovo`  — popular ONT/PacBio assembler (Hu 2024)
- `shasta`      — fast ONT assembler (Shafin 2020)

**Other assemblers (4):**
- `raven`       — fast ONT alternative to Flye (Vaser & Sikic 2021)
- `masurca`     — heavy-duty hybrid for large genomes (Zimin 2017)
- `megahit`     — short-read genome / metagenome (Li 2015)
- `abyss`       — short-read large-genome assembler (Jackman 2017)

**Polishing (4):**
- `pilon`       — short-read polish (Walker 2014)
- `racon`       — long-read polish (Vaser 2017)
- `medaka`      — ONT-specific polish (Oxford Nanopore)
- `nextpolish`  — fast polisher (Hu 2020)

All 12 verified pullable via `update/freshness_check.py` against
quay.io / Docker Hub — no yanked images.  Each declares
`source_repo:` so T2 weekly release-watch covers them automatically.

### Bumps
- Tool count: 64 → 76
- Version: 0.1.9 → 0.1.10

---

## [0.1.9] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed — critical
- `proteomics_dda` was unrunnable: `fcyu/fragpipe:22.0` and
  `fcyu/msfragger:4.1` are not public Docker images.  Recipe
  rewritten on top of an open-source stack (msconvert → Comet →
  Percolator), all images pullable from BioContainers / chambm.
- `bioflow.DockerBackend` was not re-exported from `bioflow.__init__`;
  added so users can switch from MockBackend to the real backend
  with `from bioflow import DockerBackend`.

### Added — first real-Docker integration tests
- `tests/integration/test_sdk_real_docker.py` — 5 tests that pull
  `alpine:3.19` and exercise the full SDK contract: single-stage
  exec, two-stage chaining, failure propagation, external-input
  auto-mount (BLOCKER 2), cache hit on repeat call.
- Auto-skipped when no Docker daemon — explicitly opt-in via
  `pytest tests/integration/ -m docker -v`.
- First time the SDK has been validated against a real Docker
  daemon (previously: MockBackend only).

### Added — schema fields
- Optional `pin_reason: string` — explains why a tool is
  intentionally not bumped to the latest upstream.
- Optional `deprecated: boolean` + `deprecation_note: string` +
  `replaced_by: string` — marks a tool YAML as deprecated without
  deleting the file (preserves reproducibility / rollback).
- Used by the new `comet.yaml` to replace the deprecated
  `msfragger.yaml` / `fragpipe.yaml` (no public Docker image).

### Added — T3 cron silence detection in T1
- `update/freshness_check.py` now reports both:
  - Days since the last Cowork candidate landed
    (`update/candidates/<YYYY-MM>/*.yaml` newest mtime)
  - Days since the last `bioflow update auto` run
    (`update/last_run.json` mtime)
- Maintainer is warned within 24 hours if either scheduler stops.

### Added — registry policy
- `update/REGISTRY_CHANGELOG.md` — first manual review entry
  documenting the 2 yanked images, 27 newer tags noted but pinned
  for stability, and the new `pin_reason` field for explicit pins.

### Added — type-checking visibility
- CI gained a non-blocking `mypy` advisory job; current error count
  (~36) does not block merging but is visible in PR checks.

### Tests
- 508 → 510 unit tests (+2 T3-silence detection).
- New integration suite: 5 tests passing against real Docker.

### Bumps
- Version: 0.1.8 → 0.1.9.

---

## [0.1.8] — 2026-05-15

### Added — multi-cadence registry update model
Five complementary cadences keep `registry/tools/` from silently rotting.
Previously: one monthly cadence (Cowork Deep Research → local cron).
Now:

- **T1 daily — `update/freshness_check.py`** + `scripts/install-schedule-daily.{ps1,sh}`
  - Queries quay.io + Docker Hub REST APIs for every registered image
  - Surfaces newer tags, yanked images, "tag aged out", and Cowork
    silence (>35 days since last candidate)
  - Writes `update/notifications/freshness-<DATE>.md`; exit code
    0=clean / 1=updates available / 2=yanked
  - First real run on the current registry: 27 newer-tag candidates,
    2 yanked images (`fcyu/fragpipe`, `fcyu/msfragger` — never on
    Docker Hub), 32 tags aged out
- **T2 weekly — `update/release_watch.py`** + `scripts/install-schedule-weekly.{ps1,sh}`
  - Polls GitHub releases for every tool that declares
    `source_repo: <owner>/<repo>` in its YAML
  - Files a candidate YAML draft under `update/candidates/<YYYY-MM>/`
    when upstream is newer (state-tracked in
    `update/release_watch_state.json` so the same release is never
    re-filed)
  - Honours `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var for rate-limit (60/hr → 5000/hr)
  - 8 representative tools seeded with `source_repo` for the watcher
- **T3 monthly** *(unchanged)* — existing `bioflow update auto` cron
- **T4 quarterly — `docs/maintainer/quarterly_audit_prompt.md`**
  - Cowork-side prompt for deprecation review (last commit,
    citation trend, successor-fork detection)
- **T5 event-driven — `.github/workflows/candidate-smoke-test.yml`**
  - On any PR touching `update/candidates/**`, runs
    `bioflow update auto` on only the changed dirs and comments a
    per-candidate ✅/❌ summary on the PR

### Added — schema
- Optional `source_repo:` field (regex `^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+/[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$`)
  enables the T2 release-watch for that tool.

### Added — docs
- `docs/maintainer/UPDATE_CADENCES.md` — 5-tier model with cron
  examples, exit-code semantics, and a matrix of which cadence
  catches which failure mode.
- `docs/MAINTAINER.md` now links to it from its first paragraph.

### Tests
- 476 → 508 unit tests (+32):
  - `test_freshness_check.py` (15 tests): image-string parsing for
    quay/Docker Hub variants, version comparison with build suffix,
    HTTPError yanked/check_failed branches, report rendering,
    Cowork-pulse detection, CLI exit codes.
  - `test_release_watch.py` (17 tests): `is_newer` ordering,
    candidate generation, state-file dedup, dry-run, no-releases /
    missing source_repo paths, image-tag bump helper.

### Bumps
- Version: 0.1.7 → 0.1.8

---

## [0.1.7] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed — drift from original design (TIER 1)
- `methylation_wgbs` recipe now uses the same Bioconductor image
  (`bioconductor/bioconductor_full:RELEASE_3_18`) registered for the
  `methylkit` tool YAML — the previous `_docker` tag was unverified
  on Docker Hub.
- 3 tools (`scoary`, `diamond`, `mafft`) used by the comparative-
  genomics recipes had no registry YAML.  Added — they now show up in
  `bioflow tools`, get hardware-classified, and can be picked up by
  `bioflow update auto`.
- `samtools.yaml` and `picard.yaml` stage IDs were aspirational.
  samtools is now declared under `utility.bam_processing` (it's
  bundled inline within several aligner BioContainers).  picard dropped
  its `methylation.step2` claim (Bismark has its own
  `deduplicate_bismark`).

### Changed — structural alignment (TIER 2)
- Every preset YAML that has a recipe equivalent now carries a
  ``recipe:`` field linking the two (8 presets total).  Researchers
  can still pick either entry point, but the relationship is now
  declared in the metadata.
- Added the 6 missing pipeline modules
  (`bioflow/pipelines/{chip_seq,atac_seq,metagenomics,scrna_seq,
  methylation,proteomics}.py`) so every preset's `pipeline:` value
  points to a real canonical-stage-IDs module — not just the 2 that
  existed before.
- `bioflow.core.db._DB_CATALOG` gained the 3 reference DBs the new
  recipes actually need: `kraken2_standard_8gb`,
  `10x_whitelist_v3`, `bowtie2_grch38_noalt`.  `bioflow db fetch`
  can now provision them.

### Added — UX (TIER 3)
- `examples/recipes_quickstart.py` — programmatic call signatures for
  all 8 per-pipeline recipes (the missing Python counterpart to the
  CLI `bioflow recipe run` examples in the README).
- README: new "Preset pipelines vs recipes — which do I use?" section
  explaining the two entry points and how they map.

### Tests
- 474 → 476 unit tests (+2 alignment checks):
  - `test_recipe_registry_alignment.py`: asserts every recipe's
    `@stage(image=...)` is registered in `registry/tools/`.
  - `test_pipeline_modules_present`: asserts every preset's
    `pipeline:` value has a matching `bioflow/pipelines/<id>.py`.
- Tool count: 60 → 63 (scoary, diamond, mafft).
- DB catalog: 7 → 10.

---

## [0.1.6] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: `rnaseq_deg` was unrunnable.**  Two multi-arg stages were
  fanned out with `.map()` (which forwards the whole tuple as the first
  positional arg) instead of `.starmap()` (which unpacks).  This was
  invisible to registration-style tests; only the new e2e suite caught
  it.
- `proteomics_dda`: now actually uses the `fasta_db` argument
  (`fragpipe --database-path …`) and writes the FragPipe manifest via a
  readable `for f in *.mzML; do printf …; done` bash loop instead of a
  triply-escaped inline `awk`.
- `chip_seq` / `atac_seq` / `methylation_wgbs`: replaced the bare
  `*_val_1.fq.gz` glob fed straight to the aligner with `R1=$(ls … |
  head -1)` so multiple matches no longer break `bowtie2 -1` / `bismark
  -1`.
- `scrna_seq`: set explicit `--soloCellFilter EmptyDrops_CR
  --soloFeatures Gene` so the `filtered/` matrix is reproducibly
  produced, and added a `filtered → raw` fall-back so shallow runs still
  yield an h5ad.
- `scrna_seq`: rewrote the inline `python -c` analysis as a sibling
  `analyze.py` (quoting hygiene + independently re-runnable for
  debugging).
- `prokaryote_assembly`: QUAST + Prokka stages now fall back to
  `contigs.fasta` when SPAdes does not produce `scaffolds.fasta`
  (fragmented assemblies).
- `prokaryote_assembly` returns the final `annotate` `StageResult`
  instead of a `dict`, so `bioflow recipe run … --out X` no longer
  prints `result.out_dir = ?`.

### Tests
- 464 → **474** unit tests (+10: `test_recipes_per_pipeline_e2e.py`
  exercises every per-pipeline recipe through MockBackend and asserts
  external inputs are bind-mounted + path-translated).

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **BLOCKER: per-pipeline recipes were unrunnable via the CLI.**
  `bioflow recipe run` had a hardcoded option set + `candidate` dict, so
  the 8 per-pipeline recipes could not receive `--r1` / `--sample-sheet`
  / etc.  The recipe command now accepts pass-through `--key value`
  tokens, maps `--sample-id` → `sample_id`, coerces integer values, warns
  on unknown options, and prints an actionable hint listing the exact
  missing parameters.
- **BLOCKER: input files outside the workspace were invisible to
  containers.**  The SDK mounted only the workspace and `_translate_command`
  only rewrote workspace paths, so any external `--r1` / reference / index
  path pointed at something neither mounted nor translated.  The SDK now
  scans stage arguments for external `Path` inputs, bind-mounts their
  parent directory at `/inputs/<n>`, and rewrites the command accordingly
  (files, directories, and index-prefixes all handled).  This also fixes
  the same latent bug in the existing `gwas` recipe.

### Tests
- 444 → **464** unit tests (+20: `test_sdk_external_mounts.py`,
  `test_recipe_cli_args.py`).

---

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- **8 new per-pipeline recipes** — at least one recipe per pipeline area:
  `prokaryote_assembly`, `rnaseq_deg`, `metagenomics_profile`, `scrna_seq`,
  `chip_seq`, `atac_seq`, `methylation_wgbs`, `proteomics_dda`.
  Total recipe count: 8 → **16**.
- 2 new tool YAMLs to support the new recipes:
  - `samtools` (alignment) — standalone BAM sort/index.
  - `picard` (epigenomics) — MarkDuplicates for ChIP-seq / ATAC-seq dedup.
  Total registered tools: 58 → **60**.

### Tests
- 426 → **444** unit tests (+18: per-pipeline recipe registration smoke
  tests, DAG-shape parametrised tests, registry-total assertion).

---

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- **`bioflow update auto --git-commit / --git-push`** — maintainer-only
  flags that, after auto-approval, stage the updated registry +
  CHANGELOG + last_run.json, commit with a deterministic message, and
  push to the configured remote/branch.  Skips the commit cleanly when
  nothing was staged.  Auth (token / SSH key) is the user's
  responsibility — bioflow never stores credentials.
- `--git-remote` / `--git-branch` overrides (defaults: `origin` and the
  current HEAD).
- `install-schedule-windows.ps1` learns `-GitPush -GitRemote -GitBranch`.
- `install-schedule-cron.sh` learns `--git-push --git-remote=...`.

### Changed
- README "Registry updates" section split into **Role A (maintainer)**
  and **Role B (every other clone)**.  Researchers just `git pull` —
  they should never install the scheduled task with `--git-push`.

### Tests
- 422 → 426 unit (+4: git flags off by default, commit on staged
  changes, push implies commit, commit skipped when nothing staged —
  all with mocked `subprocess.run`).

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- **`bioflow update auto`** — unattended pipeline that walks
  `update/candidates/`, smoke-tests every YAML, writes a JSON report
  to `update/last_run.json`, and (with `--auto-approve`) promotes
  passing candidates to the registry.  Designed to be wired into an
  OS-level scheduler.
- **`scripts/install-schedule-windows.ps1`** — registers a Windows
  Task Scheduler task firing every 4 weeks at 02:30; `-AutoApprove`
  and `-Real` flags pass through; `-Uninstall` removes the task.
- **`scripts/install-schedule-cron.sh`** — appends a single cron line
  (1st of every month at 02:30) to the invoking user's crontab.
- README section "Monthly Deep-Research update (scheduled)" documents
  the install one-liner and the manual workflow.

### Notes
- bioflow itself stays a *no-daemon* tool (Part 5).  Only the OS
  scheduler is long-running.
- `--auto-approve` is OFF by default — the safe scheduled mode just
  benchmarks and reports; you review the JSON before promoting.

### Tests
- 416 → 422 unit (+6: empty candidates, report emission, default-safe
  flag, unknown-action rejection, both installer scripts present).

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-11

Bug-fix release — registry tool taxonomy corrections caught by a user
review.

### Fixed
- **BWA-MEM2** was filed under `category: assembly`.  It is a short-read
  aligner — recategorised to `alignment`.  The tool stays in
  `genome_assembly.step2` (resequencing-mode "step 2" is
  align-then-`samtools consensus`), but the category now reflects what
  the tool is, not which pipeline slot it fills.  Its `output_types`
  also corrected: `[alignment_bam, consensus_fasta]` instead of the
  misleading `[assembly_fasta]`.
- **Trim Galore** was filed under `category: alignment`.  It's a read
  trimmer (Cutadapt wrapper) — recategorised to `qc`, matching its
  stage entries (`*.step1`).
- **`prokka_comparative`** registry entry removed.  It was a redundant
  copy of `prokka` with `--genus Dickeya` hard-coded — a session-1
  artefact that would have produced wrong results on any other taxon.
  The cookbook recipes already call Prokka through their own `@stage`
  definitions, so this entry was unused and dangerous.

### Added
- `tests/unit/test_registry_sanity.py` — 4 new regression tests that
  encode the taxonomy rules so future PRs can't reintroduce these
  three classes of bug:
    * naming substring → must-be-in-category mapping (catches
      BWA / Bowtie / FastQC / etc. under the wrong category)
    * aligners must not advertise `assembly_fasta` outputs
    * no two registry files share an id
    * no `command_template` hard-codes a genus / species

### Tests
- 412 → 416 unit (+4 sanity), all still pass.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-11

First public release.  Closes the 14-box roadmap in
[`bioflow_진행현황.md`](bioflow_진행현황.md) with two bonus boxes (setup
wizard + audit/cap) added along the way.

### Highlights

- **Deterministic Python SDK** for ad-hoc comparative genomics on one
  workstation — `@stage` / `@pipeline` / `parallel="auto"` / input-hash
  caching / retry-with-resource-bump / log streaming.
- **8 cookbook recipes** invoked as one-liners from the CLI:
  `download_taxon`, `pangenome`, `phylogeny`, `ani_matrix`, `gwas`,
  `cafe_evolution`, `amr_vf_catalogue`, `cog_enrichment`.
- **First-time `bioflow setup` wizard** detects host CPU / RAM / GPU
  and recommends an LLM backend (Ollama local model, or cloud APIs).
- **Privacy-first LLM companion** — disabled by default, automatic
  redaction of paths/emails/IPs/tokens before any error-diagnosis call,
  daily cost cap with pre-call enforcement, JSONL audit log.

### Verified on real data

- Dickeya genus end-to-end (262 RefSeq assemblies, 6.8 h cold,
  0.0 s cached re-run after Phase 1C)
- **Pectobacterium 12-genome demo (Phase 3 verification milestone)**:
    1. NCBI download                       5.9 s
    2. Pangenome (Prokka × 12 + Roary)    26.3 min  (6 parallel auto)
    3. FastANI 12×12                       1.0 s
    4. ABRicate × 36 runs (3 DBs)          31.7 s, 0 failed
    Total wall clock:                     ~26.5 min   summary.html OK
- 426 unit + integration tests pass

### What's intentionally NOT in scope

This release ships everything in the roadmap and nothing the design doc
forbade: no HPC / SLURM / k8s, no multi-user, no WDL / CWL / Nextflow
compat, no web UI / Tower, no LLM-data exposure, no LLM auto-execution.

### Component overview

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bioflow.sdk`     | `@stage`, `@pipeline`, fan-out engine, caching, retry, log streaming |
| `bioflow.recipes` | 8 curated cookbook pipelines |
| `bioflow.report`  | HTML accumulator (`Report.add_section / add_figure / add_table / write`) |
| `bioflow.io`      | CRLF-safe text, atomic write, download retry, URL batching |
| `bioflow.llm`     | Opt-in companion: `explain`, `diagnose_failure`, `new_tool`, `suggest_command`, `redact`, audit/cap |
| `bioflow.core.*`  | Hardware profiler, container backend, registry loader, NCBI ingestion |
| `bioflow.cli`     | `hw / tools / recommend / custom / run / db / ncbi / update / recipe / setup / llm` |
